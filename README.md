## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using the image ```:hover``` feature on a project to change the image. I understood the basics of adding  ```cursor: pointer;``` on ```:hover``` but I didn't know CSS was able to do this. Again, this is a 'NEWBIE' project and I am still a newbie.

I am also learning how to better use these Markdown items.

### Continued development

I will be continuing with the challenges at Frontend Mentor. These will help me improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to be proficient at web development.
